/**
 * Jánko Decision Candidate Registry
 * =================================
 *
 * This is the **only** file that changes when the designer opens a new decision
 * round. The Live Studio (`public/janko.html` → `studio.ts`) renders whatever is
 * declared here — labels, option badges, SVG previews and lint status — with
 * zero template edits.
 *
 * Declaring a candidate costs five lines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   id: 'corridor-hairline',
 *   label: 'Continuous Hairline',
 *   description: 'Solid spine reads as one uninterrupted Middle C axis.',
 *   options: { middleCSpine: 'continuous' },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Anything omitted falls back to the golden master
 * ({@link DEFAULT_JANKO_OPTIONS} / {@link DEFAULT_JANKO_TOKENS}), so a candidate
 * only ever states its *delta* to the current benchmark.

 * under the flared 0.65pt bracket, round 14 the restored per-hand clasp on the
 * dense 16ths of mm. 27–28, round 15 the crowded column behind hard beat-cell
 * barriers with the four rest dialects, round 16 the cluster doctrine with the
 * judged horizontal spacing, round 17A the rectangular mask with the v2 spacing
 * solver and the hugging dots, round 17B the `tight` verdict with the
 * phrase-row rests, round 18 the rest-shape verdict, round 19 the
 * symmetric-tuck clusters with the RH anchor approved, round 20 the
 * verification of the optical seats / urtext re-cut / unison merge /
 * clasp-dot fix, round 21 the measured duration ink with the slab seats and
 * the whole→64th working set, round 22 the verbatim Bravura transcription,

 * pitch-mapping paradigms, round 25 the grand grid's octave-line schemes,
 * round 26 the 0-line decision, and round 27 the fixed cores 3-vs-4 decision
 * on Brahms with real Gould ottava brackets.
 *
 * **Round 27 is a CORE round: one open axis, two answers to one question.**
 * Window-following octave lines cannot look centered: each line count has
 * exactly one middle-C-centered grammar (3 ⟺ C-lines C3–C5; 4 ⟺ middles o2–o5),
 * plus per-bar need-based rows (core±1 max) and ottava beyond extensions.
 * Judged on Brahms Op. 118/1 (lin 9–78, 964 notes) with real Bravura ottava
 * glyphs and Gould dashed spanners.
 *
 * Can we drop to 3, or does 4's floor earn its ink? Control is fixed-4
 * (o2–o5 middles, 1 folded note in m. 69), contender is fixed-3 (C3–C5 C-lines,
 * 9 folded notes across mm. 5, 15, 23, 33, 43, 53, 67, 69).
 *
 * Round 28 opens the extension-junction round on Bach Goldberg Var 1: where an
 * extension-row terminal abuts a measure barline (m. 29/30), does clean design
 * favor contact (Card A — conjoin) or separation (Card B — wide gap)? No
 * control card in View 1: the Reference view carries the standing golden look.
