/**
 * Jánko Decision Candidate Registry
 * =================================
 *
 * This is the **only** file that changes when the designer opens a new decision
 * round. The Live Studio (`public/janko.html` → `studio.ts`) renders whatever is
 * declared here — labels, option badges, SVG previews and lint status — with
 * zero template edits.
 *
 * Declaring a candidate costs five lines:
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   id: 'corridor-hairline',
 *   label: 'Continuous Hairline',
 *   description: 'Solid spine reads as one uninterrupted Middle C axis.',
 *   options: { middleCSpine: 'continuous' },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Anything omitted falls back to the golden master
 * ({@link DEFAULT_JANKO_OPTIONS} / {@link DEFAULT_JANKO_TOKENS}), so a candidate
 * only ever states its *delta* to the current benchmark.

 * symmetric-tuck clusters with the RH anchor approved, round 20 the
